import

This is the import module for perl, which imports all modules 
with the same package prefix, aliasing it away.

'import' acts as a pragma that performs a 'use' on all modules that can be 
found with the given package prefix. Any modules found have a 'use' statement 
performed, and the fully qualified package name is aliased to one without the 
given prefix. The functionality is similar to Java's 'import' statement.
